				 <h1>History</h1>
				 <p>
				 	Durham House of Pets (DHP) is a pet's company that was founded by Miko Preston and Guru Master in 2001. 
					Our first store was opened in California, US. We began with two types of pets i.e. Dogs and Cats.
					Due to high demand for pets from our customers and our tireless effort to penetrate other parts of the world, 
					the company has grown rapidly over the last ten years and now deals with over ten types of pets.
				 </p>
				 <h1>Why use us</h1>
				 <p>
					 Unlike many other pet companies, our company has been able to penetrate to over 500 countries around the world. 
					 This is to ensure each customer will at least get services from their location. In addition, all our employees 
					 are well trained and determined to serve our customers regardless of their race or location. In addition, we really
					 appreciate when our customer gives us their feedback regarding our services to ensure they are well served or else 
					 we act accordingly to ensure they are served better next time. Having been in the market for more than ten years, we 
					 are Vasant with every type of pet hence we also guide our customers on how they best maintain their pets at a cheaper 
					 cost. Most of our services are offered for free e.g. customer advice while others are offered at a very low cost to 
					 ensure they are affordable for everyone.
